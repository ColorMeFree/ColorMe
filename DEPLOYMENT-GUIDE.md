# ðŸš€ Simple Deployment Guide

## Option 1: Local Build & Manual Upload (Recommended)

### Step 1: Build Production Version
```bash
node build-production.js
```

This will:
- Read your `config.secret` file (keeps secrets private)
- Build the production version with correct environment variables
- Create a `dist/` folder with your website

### Step 2: Upload to Your Web Server
Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your web server at `free1mind.com`

## Option 2: GitHub Pages (Limited)

GitHub Pages doesn't support environment variables, so the website will show configuration errors.
